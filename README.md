In this course, Miki Tebeka presents the information and instructions you need to perform data analysis using the many tools that the command line offers for quick data analysis and visualization. Learn how to use the command line and command line tools for analyzing and displaying data. Go over Unix shell basics, and then use tools like grep, jq, sed, awk, curl, gnuplot, and others to analyze and display data from various sources, such as CSV files, APIs, databases, and more.
